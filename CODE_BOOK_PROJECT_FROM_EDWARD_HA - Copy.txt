The variables in the tidy data set are as follows:


They are measures collected from an accelerometer and a gyroscope.  
The accelerometer measures acceleration in m/s^-2 (in (meter per second) per second),
The gyroscope measures angular velocity in rad/second (in radians per second)


The variables in the tidy data set are:  

%%Subject:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years
The subject variable represent those volunteers from 1 to 30.


%%Variable:

6 variables are being measured --units are in parenthesis


frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude.mean is the mean Body Jerk acceleration (m/s^2)   
frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude.meanFreq is the mean Body Jerk Acceleration frequency (m/s^2)
frequencyBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude.mean is the Mean Body Angular Velocity (m/s)
frequencyBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude.meanFreq is the  Mean Body Angular Velocity Frequency (m/s)
frequencyBodyAngularVelocityJerkMagnitude.mean is the Jerk Magnitude Body Angular Velocity(m/s)
frequencyBodyAngularVelocityJerkMagnitude.meanFreq.. is the Jerk Magnitude Body Angular Velocity Frequency (m/s)

The term frequency at the beginning of the variable name means that the signals went thru a "noise" filtering process called FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM
The term magnitude means that the variable takes into account all 3 axis (X, Y, and Z axis)
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration

"Jerk" is the time rate of change of acceleration. It is the acceleration of the acceleration.

The "mean" is the mean of those variables by subject and activity description. 


%%Activity Description is a variable that describes how the activity was conducted. 
The choices are:  WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The data used was from Coursera Course:
1) Go to Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course"
2) Click on Course Project.
3) Click on "Go to assignment"	
4) Click on "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "
5) Variables containing the word mean, frequencyBodyAcceleration and frequencyBodyAngularVelocity will be collected. The reason why "time" variables will not be collected is because they are pre-processed.  
The time variables are prior to going through the FFT filter (Fast Fourier Transform Filter)
